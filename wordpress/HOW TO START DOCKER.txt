1.To Start docker you have to first start an environment
   - docker-machine start docker-vm
1.1 If no enviornments exists, create a new one
    docker-machine create --driver virtualbox wordpress-vm

2. Run the eval for the enviornment
    - for fish: eval (docker-machine env wordpress-vm)

3. Go into the root folder (ie where this file is) and run: docker-compose up -d

4. Go to the address of the docker enviornment
    - ip can be found by running docker-machine env wordpress-vm
        - it's the ip (minus port) for the DOCKER_HOST

5. to stop docker run: docker stop (docker ps -aq)
