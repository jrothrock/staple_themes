If I'm wanting to do a sale, instead of showing the original price, and the sale price, it'll just show the sale price. This needs to be updated.

authenticity_tokens may need to be worked on
    - especially with registering for first users when trying to purchase theme
    * May be fixed

Improve Form Title Validation - may need another database column when using a before_validation hook

Improve caching. Currently, it's pretty conservative and will have a lot more misses

Messages are pretty buggy. Should be worked on.

Maybe move upload javascript to application, as a failed upload will not add the upload script with render :new
    - this is due to the location changing to /themes instead of /themes/new
